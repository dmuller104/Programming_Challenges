Here Is Today's Task For Experts:
Given N, K and N integers, what is the maximum sum of a subsequence (adjacent elements) of length greater or equal to K?
Sample Output :-
```
6 3
5 4 -10 1 2 3
âžž 6
The sequence is [4, 6] with a sum of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
```
Notes:-
  - N <= 1e5, K<=N.
Observation:
  - Design an O(N) aglorithm in order to get the points.
