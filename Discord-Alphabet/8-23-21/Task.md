Here Is Today's Task For Begginers:
Every number greater than 7 can be written as a sum of an ammount of 3's and an ammount of 5's, for example number 11 = 3 + 3 + 5. Given N, how many 3's and how many 5's do we need in order to write N as a sum of those, if there are more variants, output the one with more 3's.
Sample Output :-
```
11
âžž 2 1
11 = 3 + 3 + 5.
```

Notes:-
  7 < N <= 1e18;
Observation:
  - Design an O(1) aglorithm in order to get the points.
